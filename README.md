# Hybrid AR Navigation System for Indoor-Outdoor Campus Wayfinding

## Project Overview

The **Development of a Hybrid AR Navigation System for Indoor–Outdoor Campus Wayfinding with Multi-level Building Support** is a comprehensive 4-week internship project that revolutionizes campus navigation by seamlessly blending physical campus geography with augmented reality (AR) overlays.

This system provides real-time wayfinding that transitions smoothly between outdoor and indoor environments, supports multi-floor routing, and incorporates advanced monitoring and research components.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. **Unified Authentication & Role Management** - Multi-tenant login system with custom university domains
2. **Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation** - QR-code marker based indoor wayfinding with 3D overlays
3. **Map-Based Routing** - Interactive 2D maps with floor selectors and path rendering
4. **Multi-Floor Support** - Elevator and stair transitions across building levels
5. **Alternative Localization** - Wi-Fi fingerprinting comparison with QR-based methods
6. **Role-Based Content Management** - Admin interfaces for POI and path management
7. **Super Admin System Monitoring** - Real-time dashboards and performance metrics
8. **Research Documentation** - Comprehensive analysis and comparison reports
